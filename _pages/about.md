I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the [Brain-Computer Integration Lab](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/li_xiaojian) at the SIAT, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research focuses on Pervasive Computing and Human-Computer Interaction, with an emphasis on exploring the development of innovative applications using Earables. Prior to thatï¼ŒI received my Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering from Xidian University.

My research interests lie in leveraging earable devices for more natural sensing and interaction. I am passionate about exploring their potential as a more unobtrusive device form to achieve the "Calm Computing" in HCI. Furthermore, I am committed to designing and developing novel interaction techniques and interfaces that can assist individuals in their learning, reading, and deep thinking processes.
